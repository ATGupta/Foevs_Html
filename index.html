<p>I had a great enthusiasm for studying environmental science. I passed out class 10 in 2011 from ICSE board. I continued with ISC board. I took Environmental Science as a subject in class 12.
<p>I could not find any particular book which was strictly according to the syllabus. I then started consulting various resources - books and internet, and made notes as per the syllabus of Environmental Science, subject code 877, ISC 2013.
<p>On this website, I put all the data that I collected. My motive is to make all the resources available for such students, so that, they may get the chapters and topics within without any starvation for knowledge. This set of information is intended for the CISCE high school [class-12] students who study Environmental Science and all other people who want to study and get acquainted with the basics of the subject.
<p>I hope that this website be helpful for you all, and you have a great time reading Environmental Science.
