<h2 style="text-align: center">DEFINITION</h2>

<p>Natural resource economics deals with the supply, demand, and allocation of the Earth's natural resources. One main objective of natural resource economics is to better understand the role of natural resources in the economy in order to develop more sustainable methods of managing those resources to ensure their availability to future generations.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource_economics)

<p><b>Resources: -</b> 
<p>Natural resources are the features of natural environment that are of value in serving human needs, or any other organism's.
<p style="text-align: right">(https://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&noj=1&q=natural+resources&tbs=dfn:1)
<br>(http://scherervillegardenclub.org/glossary.html)

<p><b>Scarcity and Growth: -</b> 
<p>Various factors such as pollution, overuse, misuse of natural resources result in their scarcity. If there is no pollution and the natural resources are used sustainably, they will certainly grow.
<p>A country's economy, beauty, health & biodiversity's growth is directly proportional to the growth of its natural resources.

<p><b>Natural resource accounting: -</b> 
<p>Natural resource accounting is an accounting system that deals with stocks and stock changes of natural assets, comprising biota [combined flora and fauna of a region] (produced or wild), subsoil assets [a useful or valuable quality of anything] (proved reserves), water and land with their aquatic and terrestrial [of or relating to the earth & its inhabitants] ecosystems. 
<p>It is frequently used in the sense of physical accounting as distinguished from monetary (environmental) accounting.

<p><b>Classification of Natural Resources: -</b> 
<table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Non-renewable resources
			<th>Renewable resources
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Nonrenewable resources are those natural resources that cannot be replaced once they are used up. Some examples include:
			<br>&#8226 oil
			<br>&#8226 coal
			<br>&#8226 gas
			<br>&#8226 uranium
			
			<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Also called:
			<br>&#8226 conventional resources
			<br>&#8226 exhaustible resources
			
			<td>
			<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Renewable resources are those resources that can be replaced as they are used up. Some examples include:
			<br>&#8226 soil
			<br>&#8226 air
			<br>&#8226 water
			<br>&#8226 wood
			<br>&#8226 sunlight
			
			<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Also called:

<p><b>Physical accounting: -</b> 
<p>Physical accounting refers to the natural resource and environmental accounting of stocks and changes in stocks in physical (non-monetary) units, for example, weight, area or number. Qualitative measures, expressed in terms of quality classes, types of uses or ecosystem characteristics, may supplement quantitative measures. The combined changes in asset quality and quantity are called <u>volume changes</u>.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2061)
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><b>Basic Principles: -</b> 
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">1. Restore and improve
<br>2. Disposal of property, plant and equipment
<br>3. Accounting for asset exchanges
<br>4. Boot <i>[Boot is the term used to describe additional monetary consideration that may accompany an exchange transaction.]</i>
<br>5. Asset Impairment <i>[When the carrying amount of a long-lived asset (or group of assets) is not recoverable from expected future cash flows, an impairment has occurred.]</i>
<br>=>Here <b><i>cash flow</i></b> is used in economics definition. We can replace it by <b><i>natural asset</i></b> (or natural resource) <b><i>flow</i></b>.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Advantages and Disadvantages of Natural resource Accounting / Reporting: - 
<p style="margin-left: 200px;"><u>Advantages</u>:
<p style="margin-left: 250px;">&#8226 Reporting is reliable and large fluctuations are minimized.
<br>&#8226 Reporting is clear and not misleading.
<br>&#8226 Management's discretion on the reported amounts is minimized.
<br>&#8226 Reported amounts are accurate and verifiable.
<p style="margin-left: 200px;"><u>Disadvantages</u>:
<p style="margin-left: 250px;">&#8226 There is no recognition of assets available for sale.
<br>&#8226 No reporting is provided on the face of the financial statements, although full reporting is obtained through the footnotes and stewardship reporting.
