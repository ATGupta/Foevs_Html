<h2 style="text-align: center">EXTERNALITIES</h2>

<p>Externalities are common in virtually every area of economic activity.
<p>Externalities are third party (or spill over) effects arising from the production and / or consumption of goods and services for which no appropriate compensation is paid.
<p>Externalities can cause market failure if the price mechanism does not take into account the full social cost and social benefits of production and consumption.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://tutor2u.net/economics/content/topics/externalities/what_are_externalities.htm)

<p><b>Kinds of Externalities: -</b> 
<p>There are both positive and negative types of the following externalities.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">A. <b>Production externality</b>: initiated in production and received in production;
<br>B. <b>Mixed externality</b>: initiated in production, but received in consumption;
<br>C. <b>Consumption externality</b>: initiated in consumption and received in consumption;
<br>D. <b>Mixed externality</b>: initiated in consumption, but received in production.

<p><b>Impacts of externalities: -</b> 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">1. Existence of externalities results in outcomes that are not socially optimal. Those who suffer from external costs do so involuntarily, while those who enjoy external benefits do so at no cost.
<br>2.  The externality may even be seen as a trespass on their (the people who suffer negative externality) lungs, violating their property rights. Thus, an external cost may pose an ethical or political problem.
<br>3. A positive externality would increase the utility of third parties at no cost to them.

<p><b>Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA): -</b> 
<p>CBA is a process by which business decisions are analyzed. The benefits of a given situation or business related actions are summed and then costs associated with taking their actions are subtracted. Some consultants or analysts also build the model to put a dollar value on immaterial items, such as benefits or costs associated with living in a certain town. Most analysts will also factor opportunity cost into such equations.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-benefitanalysis.asp#axzz25ltnprkM)

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Advantages and Disadvantages of CBA: -
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><u>Advantages</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 200px;"> The main advantage of cost benefit analysis is that it is easy to understand.  This clarity means that everyone involved will understand the monetary nature of the project and the question of its continuance. Its simplicity also means that doing a CBA is easily possible for various scenarios, locations and more.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><u>Disadvantages</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 200px;"> The simplicity of cost benefit analysis can paradoxically lead to complications. For instance, if you are performing a cost benefit analysis to determine whether or not to take on a project, you have to be able to perform accurate estimations about the benefits you would receive from the project. If your calculations are inaccurate, you could think a project worthwhile, only to later discover it ended up costing the company money.

<p><b>Social Cost Benefit Analysis (SCBA): -</b> 
<p>SCBA is a process of analyzing the social costs and total social benefits if we accept any project. We all know that to complete a big project, we need a big investment. In SCBA, we see whether return or benefits on this investment are more than its cost from the point of view of society in which we are living.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.svtuition.org/2010/11/social-cost-benefit-analysis.html)

<p><b>Environmental (or Ecological) Cost Benefit Analysis (ECBA): -</b> 
<p>ECBA is evaluation and comparison of capital and environmental costs of a project to estimate its relative merits and demerits.
