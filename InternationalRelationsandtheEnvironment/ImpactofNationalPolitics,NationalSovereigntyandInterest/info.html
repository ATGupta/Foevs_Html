<h2 style="text-align: center">IMPACT OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS, NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEREST</h2>

<p><b>International Politics and Environment: -</b> 
<p>Environmental issues are the international policy agenda. Governments will find it hard to address these issues effectively because environmental problems are not susceptible to normal political treatment.
<p>Environmental effects are synergistic [synergy = extra energy/power/success obtained by two/more people/companies working together], and environmental problems cannot be successfully tackled discretely, one by one. Their successful resolution would require a concerted, equally synergistic response unprecedented in international or domestic politics.
<p>The patterns of politics will be changed by the emergence of these issues onto the political agenda. Despite these difficulties, however, we have a powerful new means to respond to environmental problems and exert pressure on governments in the empowering effects of the information technology revolution.

<p><b>National Sovereignty and Environment: -</b> 
<p>Ironically, the best mechanism by which human beings can address environmental problems is to adopt a strong norm of the sovereign autonomy of states. The reasons for this stance are multiple, but center primarily around issues of responsibility, ownership, and pragmatics. As intuitively [automatically/spontaneously/naturally] appealing as some purely multilateral system may seem, considerable dangers exist in denying sovereignty as an operating principle of the international system and seeking a purely multilateral mechanism for addressing environmental problems. That said, there are circumstances where the norm of state sovereignty can be justly violated for the sake of the environment.
<p>The sovereign state has many features that recommend it as the best agent to serve as environmental regulator. States have a moral claim to legal and physical authority within their borders. They are capable of creating and enforcing binding laws and of holding both individuals and companies responsible for their actions in a non-arbitrary way.
<p>States are continuous, accessible institutions that can be contacted by other states and international organization, and taken to task for their mistakes.

<p><b>Impact of National Interest on Environment: -</b> 
<p>Unlike olden days, now national income lies in the favor of environment. This is because in olden times what was taken from the environment was balanced with what was reproduced, which is unlike now-a-days.
<p>Presently, laws are in the favor of environment in almost all developed and developing countries. The nations understand that environment is the basic need and one of the largest sources of their profit.
