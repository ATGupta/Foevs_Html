<h2 style="text-align: center">MODES OF EXISTENCE AND RESOURCE USE</h2>

<p>There are mainly 4 types of modes of existence, all of which we will discuss in this chapter. They are: -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Hunting and gathering
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Pastoral
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Agricultural
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Industrial

<p><b>Hunting and Gathering</b>: - 
<p>Hunting includes the killing of animals, for hide, musk and bones to sell and flesh to eat.
<p>Gathering is just collection of natural material for food, etc.
<p>Hunting has some bad impacts on the environment if done in excess. They are: -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Hunting has resulted extinction of many organisms (like mammoth) and many are on the verge of extinction.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Many animal species which are on a verge of extinction have been announced as protected. Inspite of such strict, smuggling is frequent.

<p>Until the early 19th century, Asiatic lions roamed an immense area of South and Southwest Asia, as far east as Greece and as far west as modern Bangladesh.  Beyond just habitat reduction, though, once guns arrived and became widespread, from 1800-1860, nearly all the lions remaining outside Gujarat were hunted and killed.  The last Asiatic lions in India outside of Gir forest were killed in 1886 at Rewah, and the last wild lion sighted the world outside Gir was in Iran in 1941.
<p>In 1901, Lord Curzon was offered to be taken lion hunting while visiting Junagadh.  Noting that these were the only lions left in Asia, he declined, and reportedly suggested to the Nawab of Junagadh that it would be better to conserve the lion population than to hunt it.  The Nawab began what was probably the first institutional wildlife conservation effort in India and one of the earliest in the world, banning all lion hunting entirely.  From a population reported to be as low as 20 in 1913, the lions have rebounded to now number 359 in the most recent census of 2005.  This is due almost entirely to the Nawab’s conservation efforts, and the Indian Government’s post-independence ban on lion killing in 1955.

<p><b>Pastoral</b>: - 
<p>Many people around the world depend on their cattle – goats, sheep, cows and other animals for their food and basic entities. It also includes animal husbandry.
<p>Grazing of the cattle sometimes causes overgrazing and it is harmful for soil.
<p>In many ways, pastoral is helpful. Animals’ excretory waste is helpful for soil fertility. In this way, they give away what they intake.

<p><b>Agricultural</b>: - 
<p>70% of Indian population depends on agriculture. Agriculture avails food for humans and other organisms. It is the main source of income for about 70% people in India.
<p>Agricultural lands are being availed by deforestation. The farmers follow slash and burn techniques. This is harmful for environment. They use poisonous chemicals which are useful for plants’ beauty but are very harmful for the consumers’ health.

<p><b>Industrial</b>: - 
<p>Industry avails capital on national level, not only for an individual. The largest amount of income of a country come through industries only.
<p>The waste released by the industry is harmful for the nature. Industry now-a-days is doing every type of pollution.
