<h2 style="text-align: center">HABITATS AND NICHES</h2>
<p>Habitat is the address of an organism. It is the area or environment where an organism or ecological community normally lives or occurs.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.thefreedictionary.com/habitat)

<p>A niche is the job within that address. In ecology, a niche is a term describing the way of life of a species. Each species is thought to have a separate, unique niche. The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors and how it in turn alters those same factors.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche)

<p><b>Gause's competitive exclusion principle</b>
<p>It states that when two species compete for the same critical resources within an environment, one of them will eventually outcompete and displace the other. The displaced species may become locally extinct, by either migration or death, or it may adapt to a sufficiently distinct niche within the environment so that it continues to coexist noncompetitively with the displacing species.
<p>In easy words,
<br>According to Gause's principle of competitive exclusion, species using the same resource cannot coexist. If coexisting species exceed a certain limiting similarity, i.e., if they are too similar, selection will lead to the extinction of all except one species, or to ecological character displacement.
<p>Although Gause's principle is unlikely to be valid in a strictly deterministic world, competitive exclusion is to be expected in our stochastic world. There is evidence for competitive exclusion from some experiments, but many cases of character displacement thought to be due to interspecific competition for limiting resources, are better explained by a Wallace effect i.e., reinforcement of reproductive barriers.

<p><b>Resource Partitioning</b>
<p>It is also called niche differentiation / niche segregation / niche separation / niche partitioning.
<p>It refers to the process by which natural selection drives competing species into different patterns of resource use or different niches. This process allows two species to partition certain resources so that one species does not out-compete the other as dictated by the competitive exclusion principle; thus, coexistence is obtained through the differentiation of their realized ecological niches. Niche partitioning may not occur if there is sufficient geographic and ecological space for organisms to expand into.
<p>In simple words,
<br>Where resources in an environment are limited, different species have evolved to "share" the specific resource, for example: large herbivores such as zebra and wildebeest will live together in herds in the African bushveld. They are both grazers, but feed on different parts of the grass plants. Space may also be shared in a similar way.
