<h2 style="text-align: center;">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>
<p>Off course we should thank all those who are behind a creation or something, which I consider here to be good.
<p>So first of all I would like to thank all at once - my principal, my Environmental Science teacher, all my teachers till now, my parents, my brother, my friends.
<p>My principal, Sister Mary Vattamattam and my subject teacher Mr. Arvender Singh gave me wonderful guidance. All my teachers gave me guidance in my life till now which still continues. I thank all of them, specially, for this book, my Environmental Science teacher who gave me wonderful lectures and put a seed of love for this subject in me.
<p>When I was preparing notes for the subject for my exams, my grandfather, Professor Giriraj Nandan, gave me the idea to publish it. He is a Historian himself and has written several books on the history and culture various regions of Rohilkhand (India) and the art prevailing here. Listening that idea, I doubled my efforts. After that, I started preparing notes just as I would prepare for a book. My parents, brother, Gaurang, and friends supported me and motivated me. Actually I should thank them for my existence because for any human being, they are necessary for a healthy living.
<p>My sister in law, Mrs. Preeti Rastogi, told me about the bad parts of the book so that I can improve it. I thank her for her valuable comments.
<p>I thank each and every person who played a role in the success of this work, whether acknowledged explicitly or not.
